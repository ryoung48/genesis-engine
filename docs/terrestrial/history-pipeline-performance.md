# History pipeline performance

Implemented on `optimize/history-pipeline`, based on `78f34d5`, in a separate worktree. The active workspace and its uncommitted changes were left untouched.

- Hierarchy queries read the existing child adjacency arrays directly, rather than allocating a child array at every visited province. Population queries reuse the same traversal and preserve summation order.
- Journal flushes skip empty events and reuse pending maps and people-log buffers. Completed transaction snapshots remain independent of those buffers.
- `gen:history` releases translated journal batches and engine notes every year. The full history record, including census keyframes, remains available.
- `report:history` retains childbirth-death timestamps needed by its current reporting window and releases journal batches annually. Events at an exact century boundary remain available for the following window.

## Measurements

Five warmed samples of 1,000 hierarchy queries over an 8,191-province binary tree took a median 301.9 ms before and 101.7 ms after: about 66% less time. This isolates traversal work; it is not an end-to-end speedup estimate.

Two baseline and two final runs used seed 14963991, lateMedieval, 20,000 points and 300 years:

| Measurement | Baseline runs | Optimized runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simulation + translation | 28.22 s / 26.75 s | 25.91 s / 31.52 s |
| Frame reconstruction | 0.80 s / 0.77 s | 0.83 s / 0.98 s |
| Peak worker RSS | 374 / 382 MiB | 368 / 269 MiB |

End-to-end timing and garbage collection varied on the shared machine. These samples demonstrate lower retained-data requirements and a faster isolated hierarchy path, but do not establish a reliable overall speedup. The default 204,000-point workload was not benchmarked. JSON measurements and raw local diagnostics are in `verification/history-optimization/` in this worktree.

To repeat the generation workload in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HISTORY_POINTS = '20000'
$env:HISTORY_YEARS = '300'
$env:HISTORY_SEED = '14963991'
$env:HISTORY_OUT = 'history-summary.json'
pnpm gen:history
```

## Verification

All four 300-year runs produced identical yearly non-timing fields. Century and partial-century reports matched for seeds 14963991 and 42, 10,000 points and 201 years, excluding the people timing metric. A 20-year regression test compares complete records and final frames built from streamed versus retained journal batches. Other regression checks cover hierarchy order, floating-point summation order, immutable journal snapshots, empty flushes and cancelled changes.

The targeted history tests, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` passed.

## Remaining opportunities

The CPU profile attributes substantial simulation work to repeated military deployment/alliance calculations during budget previews. Those modules overlap the other agent's active military changes, so this branch leaves them alone. Person-name generation also accounts for a substantial translation cost. A later investigation could consider generating names on demand, after defining how record consumers access them. Frame reconstruction was only around one second of the 300-year runs and is a lower-priority target.

Census keyframes and complete records still grow with history length. Compressing or thinning these would require an explicit decision about historical query fidelity; this change preserves all recorded history.
